My project is a fanpage site for the upcoming release of Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII remake. The front page contains the latest trailer for the game and there is a page within character information for the characters that have been released with regards to the remake. Other characters are found in the game and as they are released they will be added to the site. The final page is a gallery page which uses bootstrap for an image carousel and image gallery.
