                        <h2>Barret's Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            Barret fights passionately for his cause and cares greatly for his allies. His seemingly benevolent 
                            cause of fighting for the Planet is a cover for his personal vendetta and anger, which he later must 
                            come to terms with. Despite his brash and sometimes violent attitude, Barret has a good heart, and is 
                            torn between fighting and caring for his daughter, Marlene. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Barret wields gun-arm, mechanical guns grafted in place of his right arm, allowing him to fire from 
                            range. His Limit Break abilities largely consist of physical attacks with these weapons.
