            Barret fights passionately for his cause and cares greatly for his allies. His seemingly benevolent 
            cause of fighting for the Planet is a cover for his personal vendetta and anger, which he later must 
            come to terms with. Despite his brash and sometimes violent attitude, Barret has a good heart, and is 
            torn between fighting and caring for his daughter, Marlene. 
            <br><br>
            Barret wields gun-arm, mechanical guns grafted in place of his right arm, allowing him to fire from 
            range. His Limit Break abilities largely consist of physical attacks with these weapons.
