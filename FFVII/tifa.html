                        <h2>Tifa's Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            Tifa is Cloud's childhood friend from Nibelheim, but lost contact with him years ago. When she meets him again, 
                            she convinces him to join AVALANCHE, the resistance group she is a member of, to fight Shinra Electric Power 
                            Company, whom she bears hatred for due to the destruction of their hometown. She supports Cloud as his comrade 
                            and helps him and his allies fight Sephiroth. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tifa is emotionally shy and empathic, acting as a motherly figure towards her allies when providing encouragement 
                            and emotional support. Tifa uses her martial arts moves in battle, equipping knuckles as her weapon. Her Limit 
                            abilities make use of her martial arts techniques further, and unlike other characters, her Limit Break abilities 
                            are not selected from a list, rather, each ability can be used consecutively if the slots land on the "Yeah!" reel for the ability.
