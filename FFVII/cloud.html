                        <h2>Cloud's Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            An arrogant and proud swordsman at first, Cloud introduces himself to AVALANCHE as a former 
                            member of an elite warrior unit called SOLDIER who has turned mercenary, and uninterested in 
                            anything beyond his hired task at hand. He later discovers more about his past and, with the 
                            help of his friends, learns there is more to being a hero than possessing physical strength 
                            and fame, developing compassion for the Planet and people he fights to protect. He fights to 
                            protect the Planet against his nemesis, Sephiroth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cloud Strife wields large broadswords in battle, including the iconic Buster Sword, and has 
                            access to the most powerful weapons in the game. His Limit abilities involve his sword, and 
                            are the strongest, but take the longest to learn.
