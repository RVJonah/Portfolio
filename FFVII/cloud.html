            An arrogant and proud swordsman at first, Cloud introduces himself to AVALANCHE as a former 
            member of an elite warrior unit called SOLDIER who has turned mercenary, and uninterested in 
            anything beyond his hired task at hand. He later discovers more about his past and, with the 
            help of his friends, learns there is more to being a hero than possessing physical strength 
            and fame, developing compassion for the Planet and people he fights to protect. He fights to 
            protect the Planet against his nemesis, Sephiroth.

            Cloud Strife wields large broadswords in battle, including the iconic Buster Sword, and has 
            access to the most powerful weapons in the game. His Limit abilities involve his sword, and 
            are the strongest, but take the longest to learn.
