<h3>Project Aims</h3>
<p>
  I created this project primarily to familiarise myself with CSS Grid prior
  to instigating this on my Veterinary Calculations Practice project. It
  also allowed me to experiment with media content having never worked with
  video or audio embeding before.

  For further experimentation I added the gallery page which uses the
  Bootstrap column layout and carousel for visual effects that I was unable to
  manage on my own.
