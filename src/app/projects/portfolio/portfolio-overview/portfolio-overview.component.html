<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The development of this website was designed as an upgrade to my previous
  site which used vanilla javascript, html and css. It also gave me the
  opportunity to work with the Angular framework for the first time. The
  design elements and colour scheme are basic so as not to distract from the
  website functionality.
